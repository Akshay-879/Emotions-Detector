# Emotions-Detector

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing facial expressions in real-time using computer vision techniques and deep learning. The project is divided into several parts.

The first part involves capturing video frames from a webcam and detecting faces using the Haar cascade classifier. Once the faces are detected, the project utilizes the DeepFace library, which is built on top of OpenCV and Keras, to analyze the emotions expressed by the detected faces. The emotions are extracted using a pre-trained deep learning model.

In the second part of the project, the emotions detected from each face are displayed on the video frame using bounding boxes and text annotations. The emotions are represented by the dominant emotion predicted by the deep learning model.

The programming language used for this project is Python, and the required libraries include OpenCV, Matplotlib, and the DeepFace library. Additionally, the project relies on the Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

The project's outcome is a real-time video stream with facial emotion analysis. By visualizing the dominant emotions expressed by individuals, the project aims to provide insights into their emotional states. This application can have various applications, such as analyzing emotional responses in research studies, monitoring customer satisfaction, or assisting individuals in understanding their own emotions.
